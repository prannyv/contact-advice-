that’s what i don’t like 
can it be less  it makes it feel slow rather than smooth i feel like its over correcting the end half of the smooth is nice 
bothers me but if u think its fine it doesn’t rly matter lol such a small nitpick bro why do some ppl have those contact me boxes like

and also basic seo 

how much one time  how much monthly 
yeah 
okay yeah i think some pages redone  some just maintain so just waiting for old guy to send it over i think then they will define more specifically i hope 
hours is like hours worked in that period weekly biweekly monthly doesnt rly matter then but im asking this is yours in period bro this didnt make any sense my b sent it mid set lol 
mhm customer is alr sold and idt i would scare her away by pricing higher she would jus nego down but then like i also have no ethos cuz im student w not much portfolio hours is like this message responded to an earlier message hours worked in that period this message responded to an earlier message weekly biweekly monthly doesnt rly matter then this message responded to an earlier message

 sadge yeah bro what the fuck i know he hired 70 of dev team but this is crazy lol i mean ik why its cuz u can pay interns half as much  no benefits  work them a little harder in exchange for them knowing less  having to be retrained 
ur such a goon bro uw is up there only reason i agree w u is cuz they have to sponsor work visa 
u should apply but i think itll b terrible  
yeah bro u got good timing and like bro wtf twitter has no hr team how r they hiring is the new ceo doing it herself 
lol rmb what u were saying earlier how u want to be remembered or credited for what u do but the company doesnt respect workers difference at twitter is that they wont even push your feature  
they gonna keep asking for new shit and keep changing it yeah im curious how much is it 
lmaoooo pays 50 thats dope is there housing stipend plus bro u can lie abt all your experience if u get it cuz 
they still gonna have a broken hr team lmao 50 cad 
apply bro 
yeah u can watch now 
lowkey what 
has what 
oh yeah bro they reinvented bixby isnt that funny lol 
u see the ui for picking the action 
the ar one looks rly android wonder if its just a tech demo or indicative of new style 
i guess its just a tender 
render yeah 
yeah wonder what they r cooking u gonna get 15 pro then  i think pro price went up but reg is same

u get 34 then or what 
what score 
oh that’s good bro i thought was out of 1200 for a sec  
bro how do u make mockup 
rly  let me peep this is nice implementation looks rly good 
yk how projects in tldr u think its better to open in new tab 
nah u do 
i think its better for opening new item but not linking to page on your website for some reason its rly slow rn so it was showing your link in thing for like 30s so i think u were just linking to your page not the deployed app linking to deployed app should do new tab i think that’s coo 
yeah they do 
was jus rly slow idt its your thing 
this is after clicking one of your projects it loads here then redirects that’s why i thought u were linking to your own page 
why don’t u link spotify friend to app store  
how come im just wondering as well 
yeah tbh i think its 5050 so idk which is better some ppl like seeing its actually published and their like wow appp sttoooreeee but some ppl would care more abt oh u used x y z tech so who knows lmao 
i think its fine for it to be github if u make the app store link bigger on github like make an embed button perhaps… 
or u can make the tldr one link to app store 
and then long form version see gith 
ye so that’s fine u have any projects ideas for this weeknd 

blud is a hack virgin yeah bro will be fun 
also yk how u were like htn is small beans 
htn is flying ppl  offering reimbursement but university of washington can’t afford reimbursement this yr they have one shuttles… 
cuz u wrote a bum application  
it is 
delta hack i sleep honk shooo mimimimi 
bro they not copying your resume they jus tryna see exp  
but htn is looking for lack of exp so why would they need resume 
pre sure they jus sort by hacks attended 
ascending order and select from there bruh u guys r bums uw toxicity 
w bryant  or w u 
skull nah tbh jus lie make new depots devpost reset every 3 
yeah bro free attend then  i think hackathons r acc fun i jus think like this admissions shit recently is so weird like how is delta hack rejecting u  sarina  
u mean contradiction taut is always true but u always false  
efficient guy eg reactions liked by dorianzcgmailcom

yo did u do big o proofs 
calc  
im talking abt the cs one i don’t understand how to do this the cs big o proofs are so unintuitive to me… 
bru this makes no sense sob 
hakari got the jordans holay 
kinda sadge i feel like if hes still in there they woulda made the hair black or smt but surely  hell come back  
kashimo technique so sick i fw dat guy 
what is thing on your github bro u find smt for this fall  
that’s dope dude i wanted to ask one of my profs cuz he mentioned he runs one of our labs what u researching 
dayum 
 wtf for lab  
ohh i done like linux 
oh no ill ask earlier next time i sorted it out earlier td was due tn  
nah all g it was like inequality not equality so i realized it had dif rules and then jus did proof 
w the hint  
yeah i didn’t get the hint for a while nil ngl yeah lol that’s why iw as like this is so dumb i think delta epsilon is a weird proof but this one doesn’t proof its the actual time complexity just that it fits within the bound of that one right 
like from what i gather this proof is just that fn is in bound of gn 
how is 4n on2 yeah thats fine but how is this 
cuz its like sure it does exist in that bound but it also exists in n10 then 
that’s not the big o  tho this is just 2 functions sure but idk i guess good opportunity to chat w prof hes from waterloo lol 
hm 
so which part of the proof constrains it to the lowest upper bound  were just finding n0 and c right 
yeah i mean that’s the informal proof ik 
like i don’t need to proof fn  k cuz i jus know to drop k 
but im a goon so lmao like i get the formal proof now 
but the 4n on2 thing has been really confusing me 
ye but then like okay hear me out obv we know the time complexity right but since it’s not confirmed lowest via this proof how do we know its not logn 
ye that’s true 
yeah it is cuz it can always count as a bigger function but like 
then u jus have to keep checking til u find one where it fails to get lowest 
surely there’s a better way they shall teach well presumably u do 
yeah but don’t we want the lowest or wait we want the highest no we want the lowest but for worst case 
yeah i hope we will learn more efficient version 
i assume u have the method 
or u were taught it ohh yeah then u can find max or min wow this theory is so interesting idk if u like it but its sorta interesting compared to accounting makes me wanna kill myself 
u in calc 3 now  
  
 lol hidden method ill try 
4n how do i do 
4n 
n10 
mhm like for all nn0 yeah 
for which  sorry is that the thing for 
no i mean for what function 
yeah well i know that much bro  that’s how i find big o 
yeah wow convergent divergent series brain overload 
ngl im too stupid for calc 
i like cs theory for now 
nah i got ended  calc 2 i guess i could figure it out now if i had more time 
but idt i could do 4 i think u could pass 3 seems easier than 2 
like less new content  
lol i meant pass i think i could pass it 
lol yeah both calcs were like actually no way bro our calls were like 80 mc 5 question and then 20 short answer 
lowest exam mark of all time for calc 2 bro i tell u u start giggling 
actually they didn’t even reveal final exam mark lol i guesstimated that i got 55 based on prev average  final grade 
but crazy 
if i didn’t take calc 2 id have same avg as hs lmao 
our cs 2 was so easy cuz java feel bad u had c  or what 
devious we’re doing c now for unix course but only basic obvi… 
i think its good to teach c earlier to fully grasp pointers tho 
i only learnt c cuz of a club and i feel like pointers rly helped me nah i don’t fw c except pointers r cool i like garbage collection 
cpp has no garbage either that’s what i did last yr for club cuz 
we were tryna make game 
didn’t finish tho… 

we didn’t use … we did destructor 
sheebar 
 wha that 
this message responded to an earlier message sheebar this message responded to an earlier message i didn’t know there’s apps like that how does it work i used to have that problem a lot 
 no lol oh wait 
for c memory leak bro i thought u were talking abt macos lol 
we jus started c this set sem 
for mac u open activity and if cpu is 300 its over 

no problems yet knock on wood…
