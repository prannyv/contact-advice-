what type of q (+)
😭 (+)u get 3/4 then (+)or what (+)
what score (+)
oh that’s good bro (+)i thought was out of 1200 for a sec 😭 (+)
bro how do u make (+)mockup (+)
rly !? (+)let me peep (+)this is nice implementation (+)looks rly good (+)
yk how projects in tldr (+)u think its better to open in new tab (+)
nah u do (+)
i think its better for opening new item (+)but not linking to page on your website (+)for some reason its rly slow rn (+)so it was showing your link in thing for like 30s (+)so i think u were just linking to your page not the deployed app (+)linking to deployed app should do new tab i think that’s coo (+)
yeah they do (+)
was jus rly slow (+)idt its your thing.. (+)
this is after clicking one of your projects (+)it loads here then redirects (+)that’s why i thought u were linking to your own page (+)
why don’t u link spotify friend to app store ? (+)
how come (+)im just wondering as well (+)
yeah (+)tbh i think its 50/50 so idk which is better (+)some ppl like seeing its actually published and their like wow appp sttoooreeee (+)but some ppl would care more abt oh u used x y z tech (+)so who knows lmao (+)
i think its fine for it to be github if u make the app store link bigger on github (+)like make an embed button perhaps…..? (+)
or u can make the tldr one link to app store (+)
and then long form version see gith (+)
ye so that’s fine (+)u have any projects ideas for this weeknd (+)
🤣 (+)
blud is a hack virgin (+)yeah bro will be fun (+)

kashimo technique so sick (+)i fw dat guy (+)
what is thing on your github bro (+)u find smt for this fall ? (+)
that’s dope dude (+)i wanted to ask one of my profs (+)cuz he mentioned he runs one of our labs (+)what u researching (+)
dayum (+)
?? wtf (+)for lab ? (+)
ohh (+)i done like linux (+)
oh no (+)ill ask earlier next time (+)i sorted it out earlier td (+)was due tn 😅 (+)
nah all g (+)it was like (+)inequality not equality so i realized it had dif rules (+)and then jus did proof (+)
w the hint ? (+)
yeah i didn’t get the hint for a while nil (+)ngl* (+)yeah lol that’s why iw as like this is so dumb (+)i think delta epsilon is a weird proof but (+)this one doesn’t proof its the actual time complexity just that it fits within the bound of that one right (+)
like from what i gather this proof is just that f(n) is in bound of g(n) (+)
how is 4n o(n^2) (+)yeah thats fine (+)but how is this (+)
cuz its like (+)sure it does exist in that bound (+)but it also exists in n^10 then (+)
that’s not the big o  😂tho (+)this is just 2 functions sure but (+)idk i guess good opportunity to chat w prof (+)hes from waterloo lol (+)
hm (+)
so which part of the proof constrains it (+)to the lowest upper bound ? (+)were just finding n0 and c right (+)
yeah i mean (+)that’s the informal proof ik (+)
like i don’t need to proof f(n) + k cuz i jus know to drop k (+)
but im a goon so (+)lmao (+)like i get the formal proof now (+)
but the 4n o(n^2) thing has been really confusing me (+)
ye (+)but then like (+)okay hear me out. (+)obv we know the time complexity right (+)but since it’s not confirmed lowest via this proof. how do we know its not logn (+)
ye that’s true (+)
yeah it is (+)cuz it can always count as a bigger function (+)but like (+)
then u jus have to keep checking til u find one where it fails (+)to get lowest (+)
surely there’s a better way they shall teach.. (+)well presumably u do (+)
yeah but don’t we want the lowest (+)or wait (+)we want the highest.. (+)no we want the lowest but for worst case (+)
yeah (+)i hope we will learn more efficient version (+)
i assume u have the method (+)
or u were taught it (+)ohh yeah (+)then u can find max or min (+)wow this theory is so interesting (+)idk if u like it but its sorta interesting (+)compared to accounting (+)makes me wanna kill myself (+)
😂 (+)u in calc 3 now ? (+)
? 😂 (+)
?? (+)lol (+)hidden method (+)ill try (+)
4n (+)how do i do (+)
4(n) (+)
n*10 (+)
mhm (+)like for all n>n0 (+)yeah (+)
for which ? sorry (+)is that the thing for (+)
no i mean (+)for what function (+)
yeah (+)well i know that much bro 😂 (+)that’s how i find big o (+)
yeah (+)wow convergent divergent series (+)brain overload (+)🤯 (+)
ngl im too stupid for calc (+)
i like cs theory for now (+)
nah i got ended @ calc 2 (+)i guess i could figure it out now if i had more time (+)
but idt i could do 4 (+)i think u could pass 3 (+)seems easier than 2 (+)
like less new content ..? (+)
lol i meant pass (+)i think i could pass it (+)
lol yeah (+)both calcs were like (+)actually no way bro (+)our calls were like (+)80% m/c 5 question (+)and then 20% short answer (+)

actually they didn’t even reveal final exam mark lol (+)i guesstimated that i got 55 based on (+)prev average & final grade (+)
