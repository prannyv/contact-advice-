so they meed the fitness data
bmmm sounds super complicated i am cery lost in the saide tbh but i can maybe see if i can get the watch
i cannot afford one myself but id recommend getting the mid one series 8 the se seemed to b lacking certain things
i think the only thjng that is important is the temperature sensor and ecg im assuming that means it cant measure ur heart rate but i ve always been a watch guy i like actual watches more
id prob even consider a used 6 or 7 cuz there are very small changes or even a nin apple watch cuz apple lowkey scams the hell out of its users
u can spend 400 on extra storage that would cost u 120 dollars if u bought it urself

yea i just think our emergency services should b decentralized
the current system is too expensive and its overly regulated leading ti higher response times and means st the end of the day u dont own ur own emergency service

oh i have no idea how to solve that problem
yea sign uo and log in can u not get in rn
it should b one u set show me
hows the search goin
ik she asked us in our gc whats ur opinion on thr matter sire
  did i accidentally derail the negotiations if i did plz still join
i think we r lowkey ur best option at the moment like u could wait and pray but like it would b tight and ud end up w no feas group if u do get stuck in the other one
ohhhh icic well yk how big of a narcist i am so my pitch is its my group and i am the best and pitch the future was rlly fun to do with u so ye
what can i say im like harvey spectre im a good closer sign ur soul away to section 016
okay that is a fair point but from the looks of things i think more ppl r chill tho as in they dont have a group from the looks of it we r the only group in our class
and ppl dont rlly have friends here
lecia said that she found it weird taht all the white ppl sat on one side all the asians in the middles and all the brown and black ppl sat in another side
so i would say purely based on easy to switch u might b in a better position to switch with us since ppl r more laid back and don t have that many commitments
i dont wanna leave stephen hanging and we only had one spot and i would feel rlly bad if i left one of them
oh other friend
finally got home thx to my friend how is the search goin rn
omg i saw that list jesus it was long

yeah i was talking to lecia bout it but it was in passing not a serious commitment
i think rachel chen would b really good but like she def taken
as the bonfide idea girl
wut ideas do u have a for a hack cuz based on that we can prob narrow down ppl who have speciality in those area
yea but i think presentation skills r a dime a dozen at western like most ppl have good enough public speaking skills
hmm intersting is ur domain as in like if u have a good idea that would b gud
as in like if u have an interesting idea we can try experimenting w it cuz use done like bigger hackathons before right that san fr n one right

she herself has said that she does lack technicals i think she rlly was the ideas and business person in the past for hack the north she did win that one
i can check later but i gotta do the app rn
oh i did hack the north with her alright but like idk if i was j reading into things too much or if i was j like mehhh but i think we clashed a few times during the event like just cuz it was stressful and tbh i think i was resp for not winning
i can tell u later its a semi long story gotta finish tho
