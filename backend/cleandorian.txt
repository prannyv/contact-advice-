okay i got b 
okk imma put b and then try the next question and we can come back to it if ur double check comes out different 
agreed i got e also i m solving these w calculators to be quicker maybe we should do that strat for easier questions that are solvable by calculators and then we spend more time on any questions that can t be solved or are harder to be solved by calculators 
wait acc 
okk imma check out next q for the interest of time 
it might be faster if i skip ahead and do all calculatorable qs eg i just did q9 this is q8 btw does this help for q7 find a normal vector onto the line how can i find normal vector on the given line for example if i have a line 3x 5y 1 what would be the normal vector of this line i am not sure whether its useful or not but we have one m omg the ui is super ugly but i found a view to see all questions at once this way i can work through all calculatorable questions rn then come back to help w the noncalculator qs 
ok i got q10 and q9 work on q11 
d 
okk going to q12 d for q11 right i ve selected d for now heading to q12 
i got q13 
i did not work on 12

i can if u tell me what operations has to be done 
yeah that s why idrk what to do w them 
is b 13 correct for q40 if so we only have q3339 left 
yeah that s why idrk what to do w them this message responded to an earlier message 
just q3639 left and if u could just double check my q40 real quick we can submit i m working on q38 rn i got b based on this rule this message responded to an earlier message this message responded to an earlier message 
q36 q37 q39 this is priority idk how to do q36 and 37 but i m working on q39 rn i did q40 and i think it s correct but i m not 100 sure a double check would be nice but not necessary this is priority this message responded to an earlier message idk how to do q36 and 37 but i m working on q39 rn this message responded to an earlier message 
pretty sure this is the answer for q39 not 100 sure tho so double check would be nice but not necessary too only 37 left to go 
okk yeah i m pretty sure about 39 and 40 so yes we should be good 
okk that should be everything should i just submit 
okk 
okkkk is it sus if we submit before time s up cuz we started late too

lol 
this week i left dt at 1145 pm on the first day 915 pm the second day 925 pm the third day and 715 pm the fourth day today on the go train home rn i ll check my cal to see when i typically left dt last summer this summer i m planning on either taking this 713 pm go train home departing from union at 713 pm or taking the one before this the go train departing from union at 613 pm cuz i m planning on getting into office around 945 am 10 am every day so i ll work a 10 am 6 pm work day ish but my team is super flexible they ve left anywhere from 25 pm so far this week cuz we don t commit to a 95 workday we work whenever we need 
not work work related more like when we re going into office tmrw or coordinating wherewhen to meet for events etc but we re super chill and i love it cuz that s how i roll too like imma work this weekend cuz i want to and also cuz i do have more work left cuz i ve been working on other stuff during the workday this week wbu what s ur commute schedule likegonna be like 
okayy i see u take the same train back home right the stouffville go train some days i might catch the earlier train back and keep working at home like my team s pretty flexible and understanding of my commute so we could catch the same train back sometimes what time is the train that u usually get is it the 458 pm or 528 pm departure from union and interesting not a good boss then 
okayy yeah then we would prob catch the same go trains every few days cuz i m most likely gonna catch the 613 or 713 pm train home most days idk unless i develop a liking for getting home earlier acc i should prob adjust my timing to catch the 613 pm train so i get home earlier eat dinner earlier and sleep earlier 
lmao fair enough that s why my sleep has been terrible this past year and part of why i wanna improve it over the summer also can t wait for quality rest sleep and overall peace next year ohall don ftwww 
lol nooooooo my projected commitments for next year are totally reasonable okay so acc u tell me cuz eric was freaked out about just this lol one parttime internship my summer vc internship continued into the school year estimated 20 hoursweek one small ec estimated 3 hoursweek one bigger ec vp careers wfn estimated 5 hoursweek hopefully aeo2 competitor iccc during my interview i first told eric just the first 2 and the third would be included if i get the role obv and he was like okay to confirm would this be it and then i mentioned potentially iccc if i get on the team and he did a 180 and was like  uhh would u still accept that if u got the vp role at wfn  and i was like huh how was what i said much it s a reduced version already of what i m planning to do next year so give it to me straight what do u think of that list of 4 is eric reasonably freaked out 
oh yeah ofc if we re hosting events or attending events then my commute will adjust on an ad hoc basis 
hmmm i see most ppl is in the other interns at ops or other first year interns in general 
huh interesting why would they overhire in this economy 
hahaha i m just pretty knowledgeable and experienced w careerrelated stuff also cuz i m very very passionate about careerrelated stuff the reasons why i wasn t as steadfast as i would ve usually been when giving my advice on which internship u should take was a i m not as confident about technical internships as i am with businessstartup internships and more importantly b idk what jess  dad startup is idk who jess  dad is like his background   i basically had 0 info on what the internship would ve acc looked like and i was just going off of what u told me 
wdym ohhh like when she asked ppl about the ministry her questions and tone of questioning was done in a way that would ve gotten biased results eg  nooo i guess it s not that bad  
aww ok i see well it ll be different next time not much we can do now unless u wanna resign from ur ops internship lol

ivey s case comp team basically 
hahaha it s pretty selective at least for 2nd years ik at least half of this past year s second year competitors so that s good imma try setting myself up for a spot as best as i can but it s quite competitive at least based off of the selection of past years  teams 
i mean i really do like case comps so ofc it s been my goal to get onto ivey s case comp team since i knew it existed back in gr 11 haha but yeah so what do u think based off of what i wrote i really dk why eric was so concerned he asked if i would still take on all 4 and okay interesting yeah ngl ur fulltime summer internship doesn t seem very fulltime 
okay nice in reality imma do some more stuff on top of that but like lighter stuff no biggie those would be my main commitments as of rn oh yeah i might continue my other parttime startup internship at the same time we ll see then technically i would be doing 3 parttime jobs at once cuz don technically counts as a parttime job lol 
i know him the least well out of the 3 ppl interviewing me the other copres will vouch for me very much ik 
i think the outgoing vp careers present would also vouch for me if he was asked 
wdym 
like the two of them weren t concerned just eric 
wdym this message responded to an earlier message 
only one of his 20222023 directors was interviewing for vp my remaining competitors were ppl who were also interviewing for other wfn vp roles that ik they wanted more ik both of them we didn t talk about this but ik they were from those other portfolios last year so it would make sense that they d want to stay in those portfolios also idk why they revealed all the interviewees i mean i really do like case comps this message responded to an earlier message so ofc it s been my goal to get onto ivey s case comp team since i knew it existed back in gr 11 haha this message responded to an earlier message okay nice this message responded to an earlier message in reality imma do some more stuff on top of that this message responded to an earlier message but like lighter stuff no biggie this message responded to an earlier message those would be my main commitments as of rn this message responded to an earlier message oh yeah i might continue my other parttime startup internship at the same time we ll see this message responded to an earlier message then technically i would be doing 3 parttime jobs at once cuz don technically counts as a parttime job lol this message responded to an earlier message

lmaooo btw are u in office today omg wait what u re like the third person i ve heard w no data in the past 24 hours lol 
a colleague some random person i met at the conference did u run out and kk was j wondering 
oh what lol that s an interesting situation how much data do u have per month a colleague some random person i met at the conference this message responded to an earlier message 
how did u let spotify suck 20gb of data woahhh that s how go buses work u wouldn t be able to stand or something until a seat opens up btw do uk any girls who are looking for uwo housing there s only space for one roommate tho 
ohhh okay yeah i need someone to take over my lease 
yes but sometimes the landlord won t let u my landlord is extremely notoriously rude and bad overall i haven t even asked him about that option lol 
would ur friend be willing to break her lease do uk how much her rent is and how close her house is to campus 
oh lmao yup 
too much for what 
wait is she in a two bedroom those are usually over 1k 
yes 1kmonth rent in london is unreasonable and unnecessary and not worth it lol i think i told u this already but since i took over the house from the girls who lived there for the past 3 years the rent s pretty competitive at 700month it s especially competitive bc the house is so close to campus 12 min walk away so no need to bus if ltc is being annoying u have to bus for masonville 
yesss pls do i ll also ask a friend who has been living at masonville already is familiar w masonville leases if breaking out of them is easypossible or not 
ohhh for safety reasons or what reasons if uk 
it has a good reputation on the surface but i ve talked to ppl who have lived there already and not everything is as nice good as it appears lol i was looking into masonville yards before i signed my lease 
what does that mean 
ohhh okok 
cuz donning is so much more worth it like for her it s spending nothing on rent vs spending 12000 for the year which hall is she donning at do uk also the living conditions are unparalleled i get my own washroom kitchen and living room too but that s cuz i m at ohall i wouldn t have taken don if it was in a traditional fs lmao it has a good reputation on the surface this message responded to an earlier message but i ve talked to ppl who have lived there already this message responded to an earlier message and not everything is as nice good as it appears lol this message responded to an earlier message i was looking into masonville yards before i signed my lease this message responded to an earlier message ohhh okok this message responded to an earlier message cuz donning is so much more worth it this message responded to an earlier message like for her it s spending nothing on rent vs spending 12000 for the year this message responded to an earlier message which hall is she donning at do uk this message responded to an earlier message also the living conditions are unparalleled this message responded to an earlier message i get my own washroom kitchen and living room too this message responded to an earlier message but that s cuz i m at ohall this message responded to an earlier message i wouldn t have taken don if it was in a traditional fs lmao this message responded to an earlier message

   also what vp money ok so i take it u don t have one 
okk nws do uk anyone who does i need someone to help me test an app for a side thing i m doing 
a bit more productfocused basically hosting a focus group to get user insights for a startup s app then analyzing that and leveraging the insights to inform my recommendation for improving the flow of a core part of the app how old anything above apple watch 4 will work with the app also wait would u be able to borrow her watch to do the testing or do watches only work with one person apple watch is the one apple product line idrk much about yet cuz i ve never seriously considered getting one until now hehe

yupp getting the data first then developing the strategy okok nws do uk anyone else w an apple watch who d be down to be my focus group participant or is generally interested in startups or wanna learn more about vc lol 
nono not questionnaire they d test the part of the app then answer some qs w me on call yess 30 amazon gift card for completing this 
okkk tysm i need at least 1 person but ideally 2 ppl but i cannot remember if anyone ik has an apple watch lol also preferably they re either techoriented or fitnessoriented because it s ai x fitness they don t have to be a crazy gym person or anything but preferably they know how to do some workout moves 
kinda not really so basically rn there s already fitness data for a bunch of exercises but there are obv a lot more exercises out there so i m evaluating a new calibration feature and doing a bunch of product market competitor etc analysis to recommend whether they should continue adding exercise data from the company end or to continue developing the user calibration data end 
yeahhh it s an interesting project but my focus group participants just need to use the app that s it i m doing the rest so hopefully it s not too complicated for them ouuuuu okay sounds good i ve been thinking of getting one but idrk yet still debating idk which one i would get btw i need to have all focus groups done by august 9th at the very latest so hopefully i can find my 12 ppl by then if u re planning to get an apple watch lmk i d be so excited i love apple 
oh yes ofc i m not getting the crazy expensive ultra i m debating between series 8 and se but leaning more towards se yeah se doesn t have a few things but only a few tho most importantly doesn t have alwayson display then can t do temperature sensing just allows u to have more health data and charges slower than the series 8 
no they can but diff levels of functionality series 8 on the left and se on the right oh trueeeee i remember that 
interesting what s a nin apple watch oh yes i agree apple s pricing is one of the only things i disagree w 
so true bruh this acc sucks so much 
woah wdym 
ohhhhh makes sense idk tho if i get it i m acc getting it for increased integration into the apple ecosystem that d be first reason and fitness would lowkey be second lol

what nooooo they suck bc they aren t like grey s anatomy doctors 
if they were then i d go see them so much more 
rightttt omg and omg lmaooooo that s acc hilarious 
lmaoooo that sucks 
wait why d u only sleep for 25 hours also is that the go bus that doesn t look very goy 
oh hahaha mhmmmmm uak business through and through what are ur thoughts on kdramas in general i haven t watched one before yet 
yeahh that s fair that s why i ve been watching less of things in other languages for a while now is there anywhere in markham i could chill in like a quiet study room vibe where i could also take meetings if needed that isn t at a library or is library the only option 
okkk good to know hmm ig markham is just a very chill residential area overall 
yupp that s true it s ok i was just wondering if there were weworkcoworking type vibes available in markham 
oooo i think i get wym okok good to know i was gonna ask again when ur summer internship ends cuz i saw someone who works at ontario digital service ods end today and i was like what but yeah we re ending the same day aug 18 have u decided when u re going on ur next trip yet lol 
u re planning it rn 
is that next next monday is that a proper holiday 
i m still not sure whether that ll be a holiday for me or not ok wb like all of canada 
ooooooo okok no way woah that s nice woah a day off sounds so nice to me rn acc a week off is needed a day is barely anything 
not reallyyy that s acc one of the only weekends this summer i don t have much planned for rn 
wait u count friday as part of the weekend i have something in the evening of friday aug 4th haha 
both it s an ec so i consider it both haha 
hahaha that s how i like want it i want to be acc passionate about everything i do and i try my best to set myself up for that the monday u mean 
hmmm if everyone s off then i might spend the day w my family instead 
since i m gonna be going back to london pretty soon too btw how s ur personal website going i might finally get started on it sometime this upcoming week 
omg yeah that s why i intentionally don t wanna code my website i wanna use a nocode or lowcode tool to build it that and also i m not comfortable enough w html css javascript to code it without thought like it s not hard to learn but i ll have to search things up and that ll take time even if it s incremental bits uk and i m tryna focus on the design content not the coding prowess 
lmaoooooo this is why i m def not coding it it s not worth my time rn to properly learn and i m also a perfectionisthighachiever so if i do acc decide to hard code it i would then spend a lot of time to acc learn everything the best ways to do things and the best things to do and it d turn out amazing but only cuz i d spend a lot of time to get there and since there s already an existing learning curve just not worth it uk 
hahahaha oops the ppl i was hanging out with during oweek were also like that cuz we legit just got to western and i was already stopping and saying hi to ppl i knew everywhere we went 
nope i mean i m still friends w them and we say hi and briefly catch up and stuff whenever we see each other but they re not my main friend group i realized that already from the beginning tho lol i m the only business student and aeo out of the group which wouldn t be a big deal on its own but also they don t have the same or anywhere close of a career mindset as me and if they did it s mostly not businessfocused either so good to chill and hang with but would ve taken a lot of effort to stay friends in the longterm cuz not much in common and we also don t see each other too often no classes or ecs in common etc u stayed w the same friend group from oweek right 
interestinggg hehe it definitely is it s not as much career hungry than career motivated or passionate imo cuz i personally attribute desire for money to career hunger and money is not my main motivation otherwise i d be gunning for ib or pe instead of vc money s a byproduct imo 
working in the npo sector could be lucrative too so if i do that i d j go for the big leagues i was very involved w the npo scene in hs i ve envisioned working as the executive director of an npo before but the issue w that is that unless u re in charge of a huge npo or charity i think the extent of impact is capped so i d rather go the startup route and i wouldn t start off in leadership positions in the biggest npos or charities hence i d waste time doing things with smaller impacts on the world but being in npos and social impact in general is something i m pretty passionate about like one of my ecs rn is acc still social impactfocused but it s overall harder to show that rn cuz social impact and profitable startups are opposing things 99 of the time which definition

because i ve been there before it s not gonna fit anywhere near the amount of guests unless they booked out the entire floor cuz this is a big guest list idk what they re doing i might text one of the ppl ik who are organizing this just to chek cuz idk how into this i am rn it is a nice venue tho and also i lowkey already forgot some of the names i knew from the list there were 364 lol and i just skimmed through real quick also with that many ppl it will be extremely hard for u to find someone specific u re looking for if they re a stranger i m not kidding it will be ridiculously squished tmrw unless they booked out the whole floor and even then it ll be a tight fit 
fr like why tf did they not control this guest list 
yeah lmao idk what u just said

same lmaoooo i had a pretty good turnout it was like 1520 out of 45 i have one of the biggest floors lol a lot of my frosh also told me beforehand that they couldn t come bc of class which was unexpectedly nice same lmaoooo this message responded to an earlier message 
all good made it through the night w the help of their roommate woke up the next day was a bit hungover and confused but their roommates helped orient them since i couldn t really support the person i supported their roommate as much as possible and talked w them afterwards too on the day of and a few days after to make sure they were okay cuz i could tell it was really traumatic to have the medics appearing and a vomiting and slurring person to take care of out of nowhere and the person wasn t responsible enough to take care of themselves in general but especially not in that state so the roommate felt personally responsible to make sure the person survived the night which isn t the case at all but the roommate s a very kind person 
oh yeah edited 9 seconds later we re lowkey responsible for their safety and wellbeing 247 in every way possible physical mental emotional even relationships if that s the kind of bond i have with a frosh or if a frosh comes up to me about that we don t need to ensure it but a good don should be doing as much as we can to help it but there are levels to commitments from dons lol overall tho i d say my ohall don team this year is a really good team we re not all tryhard dons most of us aren t lol but we care about our students and i can see that from everyone and i respect it eh i don t my medsyd floor was full of white ppl who weren t my vibe idrk how to explain it but they didn t really know what they were doingnot responsibleish but not those things exactly it was just off apparently one even decided to drop out of university after the first 3 weeks because it was too hard  he was in bmos 
it s not j that the content from their classes in general isn t hard too so like   yeah i wasn t interested in hanging around them is all all good made it through the night w the help of their roommate woke up the next day was a bit hungover and confused but their roommates helped orient them this message responded to an earlier message since i couldn t really support the person i supported their roommate as much as possible and talked w them afterwards too on the day of and a few days after to make sure they were okay this message responded to an earlier message cuz i could tell it was really traumatic to have the medics appearing and a vomiting and slurring person to take care of out of nowhere this message responded to an earlier message and the person wasn t responsible enough to take care of themselves in general but especially not in that state so the roommate felt personally responsible to make sure the person survived the night which isn t the case at all but the roommate s a very kind person this message responded to an earlier message

oh damnnn oh true yeah i get wym things are def getting expensive nowadays tho wait do u remember if u had 1 or 2 fire wardens for ur floor last year 
yeah right i had 1 too i had 1 elected for my floor last night but some dons are saying 2 and that was not what happened last year 
bruh okay well i made every candidate go through an intense and funny selection process so they ll be equipped for sure omg i just spent the past hour messaging my floor w a bunch of announcements updates there s a lot going on in residence life for firstyears rn and then dming a frosh who dmed me freaking out about missing this week of classes bc she s sick and went home 
yeahhh i agree they were all stressing about courses already there s actually a lot u can do as a don if u care about ur frosh but there s also a lot u can skip doing if u really don t care and u re just doing the position for the sake of it like it just depends on the don and the type of don they wanna be i m learning more and more about what being a don acc means w every passing week and it s only been 35 weeks since i started and 2 of those weeks were training so doesn t really count like it s acc surprisingly extremely rewarding and fulfilling to me i ve helped so many ppl in just the past 15 weeks like i d say half or more of my frosh have asked me 1on1 about one thing or another and it s soooo varied it s crazy 
and since i have such a big floor that s around 20 students i ve been able to help already and ahhh i love it my frosh is awesome 3 
yeahhh i agree this message responded to an earlier message they were all stressing about courses already this message responded to an earlier message 
what u mean recently why when 
what u re kidding prime minister justin trudeau 
no way where s the proof why wasn t there any marketing on this wouldn t they want as many students as possible to show up 
damnnnnn wait ethan what s ur availability tn u have wileyplus access right for 2257 
what time 
nono but i need wileyplus 
nono 
not about buying textbook 
nono nothing to do about buying 
i need to access the list of ppl enrolled 
i think i do i just need the wileyplus website 
yes 
nooo that isn t the issue rn u re about to become unavailable right if so it s okay i ll figure it out 
pretty good well acc we haven t been searching but i ve been on a call w sarah 33 for more than an hour and she s been trying to convince me to switch to her your 2257 section and join her your feas group 
omg she acc did hahahahhaha she said she wanted to i didnt know she acc did 
nonono what s ur opinion 
nono ur group also has no availability on student center 
hahahaahahha omg u are very straightforward at least it took around 15 hours for sarah to get to this stage 
lmfaoooo i m rewatching suits rn too so that was a perfect timing ok so sarah deflated a lil when she realized it s prob easier to convince ppl to switch w me if they re from section 20 cuz same day same time than section 16 cuz diff days diff times 
in ur section woah okay 
oh strange 
i think this is weird tho lmfaoooo 
damn okok i think this is weird tho this message responded to an earlier message also wait lecia s in ur section why isn t she in ur room group 
who is stephen 
can i call u rn real quick sarah s going to the washroom so i have a few mins to talk i m so conflicted on what to do omg how do i get past ur dnd i called multiple times and it s still going to the controlled calls how s ur dnd so strong i think mine lets through anyone who calls more than once 
sarah sourced everything omg she is so sweet 
exactly crazy 
not yet but i also haven t had a chance to reach out to many yet unfortunately fell asleep last night after i hopped off my 45 hours of nonstop calls and then today i ve been doing internship work or on callsirl meetings but now i m about to see if i can find the course coordinator today and talk to her irl 
the thing is not really time to schedule calls deadline is 1159 pm today sharp 
but this is the list of ppl sarah helped get for me 2257 game plan section 16 68 people andrew ashmore linkedincominandrewashmore04 cam beaton cambeaton12 soham beharie linkedincominsohambeharie920567261 eli bensimon linkedincominelibensimon liam bousada linkedincominliambousada066b01263 isaac c yes exactly 
and make sure no one loses their 2257 spot 
u can start messaging section 16 ppl if u want but i m not asking u to cuz it s a lot to do and u don t have to wait do u know william better or at least somewhat 
cuz both sarah and i don t know him 
like he s just an acquaintance no i think sarah was referring to wfn vp design william 
lollll yup exactly 
wait pause on outreach i finally found a course coordinator to speak w i just dropped section 21 to take the risk and play for a preferred section high risk high reward but i minimized risk acc bc the course coordinator loves me and is so on my side and basically said they re gonna get me into a 2257 section one way or another by the weekend so low risk high reward that s the game to play 
nono i dont wanna be so entitled and only give 2 sections imma give at least 3 sections cuz they said give as many sections as possible 23 is good enough 
nono i didn t say 3 she just said give as many as u can but she really likes me and she really thinks i should be someone getting into a 2257 section 
like i should ve reached out way sooner so they could ve put me in a 2257 section already so imma be very nice and polite but only offer 3 
lol 
wdym 
yes yes it is i can try wording my preferences but like do not wanna be entitled and unappreciative of their help 
hahaha not this exactly this is really stressful can i call u rn are u free a bunch of 2257 sections opened up shit 
wait nvm let me just do something about it first 
huh u need to wait 2 ish hours for ur bus 
ohhhh are u going to hack the north this weekend 
woah is justin trudeau in town again jk i saw a vid of the whole lineup of cars when justin trudeau was in town not as cool as the us president s motorcade tho 
what he didn t do that for u either i don t see ur point ethan 
no way u said president and u acc use it differently no way u met a us president 
exactly lmao 
did u mean ss as in secret service cuz i don t think that s the terminology for canadian pms either that s just for american presidents 
hahahaha i ve never read anything about the canadian prime minister s security detail lol or seen anything about it 
none yet haven t heard back from the ivey 2257 course coordinators i m currently just in a random section 
ikkkkk still waiting i m hoping they ll come to my aid still but since i m in a random section it s less likely but i had no choice there was only one open spot left and i couldn t risk that ivey coordinators can override western s adddrop deadline so i just took the only open section left right before the deadline hit exactly lmao this message responded to an earlier message that was my point did u mean ss as in secret service this message responded to an earlier message cuz i don t think that s the terminology for canadian pms either this message responded to an earlier message that s just for american presidents this message responded to an earlier message none yet haven t heard back from the ivey 2257 course coordinators this message responded to an earlier message i m currently just in a random section this message responded to an earlier message

not publicly but internally gave a heads up on slack it s prob bc of notif settings i can help u check slack i love slack but it can get very specific that is part of why i love slack tho 
i m pretty sure i don t remember cuz i haven t been checking slack as much lately either cuz of all the 2257 mess i just remmeber seeing it somewhre i m in class rn i can ss and show u later if u really need it 
okayyy nppp u really dislike slack huh 
wait does rula have office hours today cuz i just went to my firstever 2257 class 
and there were freakin open seats wtf 
what time 
this was not the case for ur class yesterday cuz i had 6 or more open seats 
still tho if there is at least one open seat uk i just need one 
no but ppl drop later on everyone knows that 
the profs the academic counsellors etc 
nono i was there today as we filled in the seating chart i counted the empty seats irl not just on the sheet at least 6 if these are indicators of ppl who are gonna drop i just need to convince them to overenroll me for now according to student center but if they re gonna drop anyway later just talked w rula again more like chatted 
i don t think anything s gonna change i think imma be stuck in my current section 
not 100 yet but likely it s not networking skills 
it s stupid admin silly administration 
nooo i m not gonna become an arsonist rn no later yeah but rn i m free what s upp 
ooo i can come 
oooo okay i might drop by 
okk i can come by rn for a bit where in aceb oh nvm i was working on the case earlier 
i thought u were working on the case rn lol 
oh darn okok im not done yet i was gonna finish today or tmrw since my class is on thursday morning oooo okay i might drop by this message responded to an earlier message 
okk this message responded to an earlier message i can come by rn for a bit this message responded to an earlier message where in aceb this message responded to an earlier message oh darn okok this message responded to an earlier message im not done yet this message responded to an earlier message i was gonna finish today or tmrw since my class is on thursday morning this message responded to an earlier message 
okok i might not be able to stay that long but good to know 
okkk i might not be free to meet later idk yet but we can also facetime if i am free later wait is the info session any good 
excuse me 
okayyy i lowkey wanna go just for the pizza i m strangely hungry today i ve already eaten one meal tho 
what noooooo u were so excited about it dwdw all good ethan can u try to count if there are any empty seats in ur 2257 class today this is prob gonna be my final attempt to try to switch my section from my current random section to another one 
thanks ethannn yup that doesn t matter as long as there are empty seats i can try using that as leverage 
hehehe oh wait u can also see the section 16 seating chart i m sure u have from ur class on monday but that s less accurate than counting irl today cuz maybe some just forgot to add their name 
oh no wait what 
what does that even mean 
ohhhh 
wtf 
is a student still there tho like on a temporary chair or something 
but a name tag is there 
wait can u send the seating chart spreadsheet link 
nws nws yeah we can talk after 
wait where s the island 
okok wait aren t there 2 empty spots one next to matthew kelly and one next to carina luo interesting lots of random ppl idk in ur class too so many ppl taking 2257 
michael thien 
he s on the seating chart tho i m saying there are 2 spots on the spreadsheet w no names at all so technically 2 spots no wait where s the island this message responded to an earlier message nws nws yeah we can talk after this message responded to an earlier message 
bruh what is this name tag seat so there s a physical name tag there but there s no physical person there 
what if it s from last class or something 
whattt 
yes pls im assuming the weird missing seat is not available 
so i guess just 1 spot available u re sure it s not sarah chan s name tag right 
okok 
okayy i guess then the only option for me would be the spot next to matthew kelly cuz don t u all keep ur own name tags and bring it to each class so it can t be some other sarah s right 
okok thank you sm heads up i m prob gonna talk to academic counselling around 3 pm so right when ur class ends i ll try to wait for as long as possible so u have time to ask rula i have a class at 330 tho and academic counselling dropin ends at 4 pm that s why i can t wait until the very end 
ask who ohh to talk to rula going to talk to academic counselling soon 
shi who did u ask rula or students 
ohhhh that s what u meant edited 4 seconds later ok but that s easy fix i just grab a chair from outside 
ok but my concern is if there s a space for me in the class not physically as well on student center every section including section 16 is still full 
shit okay i just talked to academic counselling it s more up to ivey i need to have the professor course coordinator and one of the ivey directors of the business foundations courses to send an email to the social science associate dean to get western academic counselling to override and grant the switch the professor rula i ve got in my corner and the course coordinator was also very supportive last friday but she s not sympathetic anymore and if she s not sympathetic then there s no way she d support my case with a codirector unless i go over her head and appeal to the codirector myself and he makes her support my case there s literally no other way 
wait i updated sherry on this today cuz i was w her irl did she tell u guys yet 
omg my type of ppl thats me exactly too okok let s call wait gimme 2 mins i ll call u

i had to run an event yesterday night as a don so after i got back from the football game i basically just ate dinner and prepped for the event then ran the event nono i spent it w a don friend who was also on duty that day cuz i was on duty yesterday during the day 
it was an ohallspecific residence event 
omg yeah come visit me omg i haven t visited u yet either wait u live somewhat near ohall right 
yooo did u interview hailey mitsubata for projects 
ok i can text him too i was just gonna confirm if this is the same person i m talking about i met her at agm terrible terrible vibes i was lowkey disgusted even she was networking for the sake of networking but the thing is she was terrible at networking too like if u re gonna be fake like that at least do it well but she forgot my name within 2 mins and then she went on to absolutely call the other vps she talked with before me by the wrong name like completely wrong for all of them so disrespectful and she didn t even care that much about that like i absolutely could not stand her and she was talking with me for the sake of chatting with a vp like any vp she wasn t even interested in careers she said so and then asked me the most basic questions ever like how s economics how s second year etc like she s trying so hard to network but is absolutely terrible at it and so so fake the fakeness was so obvious i was gonna bring this up to whoever s portfolio she applied to as a heads up i just found out she only has 61 connections on linkedin lmao no linkedin headshot which is why i needed to confirm w u if this was the same person is in 4th year lmaoooooo the only reason i let her go easy was bc i thought she was a new first year but nope she s in 4th year and about to graduate gl in the real world dude like i ve met so many ppl at networking events and this interaction was so bad it acc disgusted me being around her she was also totally unfocused on our convo after 30 secs she was looking around for the next vp to talk to that s when she started asking me if certain vps  names were x and y and i was like lmfao she did not get a single one right i didn t correct her either bc i had 0 respect for her at that point like she was so obviously connectionshungry but then also incredibly horrible at it like i only rant when someone really ticks me off and just 2 minutes around her was enough to do the trick 
no like 30 seconds in and my impression of her was going down 2 mins and i was actively trying to end the useless conversation and get away from her and not waste more minutes of my life i have absolutely no respect for her lmfao on her resume she listed ds1000 and cs 1026 and cs 1027 and then two upper year courses but she s a fourth year and 35 courses listed were first year courses also she was like some golf sales associate or whatever i did not care to remember for last summer her 3rd year summer internship at a golf course not even anything related to what she was studying too 
nope not at all from what i could tell 
yes did u just interview her nope not at all from what i could tell this message responded to an earlier message 
do u have thoughts 
yuppp call me 
nothing he only applied for projects 
wdym 
wait wdym like evan my covp told thomas to do a bg check on ethan won trust him then if evan says something like he has a reason to i can ask evan about this more if u d like 
here u go signin access google docs with a personal google account or google workspace account for business use 
how was jenny s second round interview w u 
yes i m still awake but evan and i are working on some careers stuff rn 
oh nono i didnt talk to evan about hailey yet 
that was my own impression 
i don t as long as we re talking about the same person yooo do u still need to call 
okk ur dnd is really strong for some reason like i can t get past it no matter what that has happened multiple times call me 
ohh okok nws 
hailey or jenny 
  did evan cynthia and i not convince u otherwise what s hardeep saying about her 
from what what experiences of working with her 
she is a keener but bad vibes 
let s just say if she is on the team and shows up to any internal social events evan and i will be giving her a wide berth but i haven t spoken to cynthia directly about her i ve seen her texts to evan about her tho and the feelings are mutual all around like truly we simply don t wanna be around her 
lol but yeah at the end of the day it s ur portfolio this is three of our very very very negative experiences w her but i ve also heard positive things about her so up to you 
okay hopefully not 
ofc happy to help also wait is ur 2257 section still missing those 2 chairs the more im in my current section the more i think i cannot live with this being my section lmao 
okk wait sorry did u say u were gonna head out sorry i m being all dony and getting a bunch of stuff for my floor students hehe 
ik this isn t the same in ur case since u re a dude lol but text me when u get homeee 
bruh  i can t believe u have that on ur wall 
i honestly would not be able to have that flag in my room 
why do dons have quirky personalities i don t get it 
isabellejgangmailcom i honestly would not be able to have that flag in my room this message responded to an earlier message isabellejgangmailcom this message responded to an earlier message 
why do dons have quirky personalities i don t get it this message responded to an earlier message also do u have any thoughts on airfryers 
wait ik it s in the name but can i only fry things with them 
like i d fry everything i make with the airfryer so can i still make healthy things with it 
oooo okok so it s good for cooking healthy things acc hmm do u have any airfryer recommendations and do u see an airfryer making it a lot easier for me to cook cuz rn i m still only using my meal plan 
like what are the benefits of having one save time save effort etc 
how tho is it like a rice cooker i can just put things in it and it ll cook 
true but can i leave it unattended cuz how else will it save time 
can u send the link to this or the product title do u have this one 
wait are there specific reasons for this vs others i know nothing about air fryers 
woahh okay that sounds really convenient wait are there specific reasons for this vs others i know nothing about air fryers this message responded to an earlier message 
okayyy sounds good wait did someone end up hiring hailey she s on our slack 
who 
okk well at least she ll fit the mentee profile cuz there s a lot she can learn from him 
yeahh i don t have much against her i just don t respect her after experiencing how she acts when she s going for an opportunity she assumably cares about are u going to the wfn party tnn 
same how are u planning to get there back 
same bus for getting there and bus or uber for getting back for me i d just take the 9 thereback is it the same for u cuz u live just down the street from ohall right so should be similar busses and im not sure how long imma stay yet somewhere between 13 hours prob i have some work to do so it also depends on how much i get done in the next 2 hours wbu 
omg exactly same cansbridge is one of the things i need to do 
what 
not very far lmao like not that far at all but idk i m caring a bit less for this year cuz i m currently really trying to hit pm in sf and be fully immersed in tech like maybe 3rd year would work better for getting it if anything that s where my head s at rn anyway yeah the party is kinda bad timing for us i agree but evan s my covp and all our directors are showing up so i m tryna go for them if anything 
due today too fair enough then evan stressed to show up on time again rn i m thinking of taking the 9 pm bus so we ll get there around 910 pm cuz the bus before that we ll get there way too early like 830 or something then there s a 956 pm bus from his place to ohallur place there s also one at 1024 pm so we d be there for just over an hour and get home with 1 to 15 hours to spare for our apps 
hahahaha at the end of the day we both know who is who in the reel i sent u   hehe wait so are u down to bus together there and back since it won t be too late by the time we leave 
i was gonna say drinking then submitting a job app might not be the best idea but yeah sounds goodd i m not sure where ur stop would be for the 9 but i ll send the exact bus times for ohall at least and then u can just find the right time for ur stop from there cuz u d just board a few mins earlier than me and u d get off a few mins later than me 
remind u what to leave 
lmao okk i can try to ok ngl tempted to not go so i can focus on my app 
i might just leave on the sooner bus cuz i really wanna go for my team oh wait am i tripping or is it just 3 questions the optional video submission idk why i remembered more qs when i looked at the form earlier 
not now 
yeah that i do wanna go it s just the app 
as of rn google maps says 910 pm 8 mins delayed but i don t trust that we should expect for the possibility that it s on time 
yes that one like it says delayed 7 min now instead of delayed 8 mins so yeah just be prepared to be there at 9 pm wo any delay basically and be prepared to wait a couple mins if it ends up acc being delayed 
ok yeah im lowkey tempted too but the video are u really gonna film it in a mcd s lol 
true wait would airpods pro anc work 
or does it have to be proper headphones what 
i have to get ready 
for party not video but that too ig also it s just like 15 mins away lol where did u get the 3040 min from 
it is it really is we cannot just do that 
all i have left to do is pick outfit change do makeup i m still working on my app rn tho lol so i might just yolo and for tonight and quickly get ready ngl i might run late we ll see 
ik i might just put on makeup on the bus lmfao bruh the bus came early like i was watching it it just sped up in the last minute to now bruh are u on it alr i might just catch the next one 
like it suddenly changed up at the very end bruh

okok so can i call u back in a few mins 
not 2257 related 
i ll text i m still in silent study zone do uk about the w5 summit case comp this sunday 
are u available for it 
it is but ik the team i ve been tryna find ppl for ages so the thing is it s teams of 34 right 
but i haven t been able to find ppl who are available cuz a lot of them have conflicting midterms so i got them to agree to a team of 2 for me cuz literally it is just me myself and i rn like everyone i ve been asking is unavailable cuz there s this midterm for a bird course 
exactly like everyone s out like all the usual case competitors i mean cuz i m not tryna find newbies uk cuz if i m gonna compete in a team of 2 then i d have to fully teach them what case comps are and how to do them since it s just me and them like i d rather do it solo at that point wait acc they might be strict about reg for this comp cuz there are def a lot of first years interested so scheduling on their end will be tough 
yeah i could try asking but also i think this is genuinely the universe telling me not to do the comp cuz i ve been trying to get ppl for over a week now i finally just got one person last night but then they dropped earlier today 
eh i think i m a bit sick hard to focus i m slightly feverishoverall body temp is high i have a sore throat headache stuffy nose etc so not doing the best rn 
i know i knowwww everyone says that all the time 
nono don t apologize i m saying u re right i really gotta rest more 
i m not sure i m resting a lot today and not fully grinding 2257 to try to recover asap 
no i ve been home all day i m feeling better now so i m planning to go to campus maybe later today to study w a group or just keep staying home and studying 
what are u planning to study 
no like what about 2257 review concepts do supp cases comprehensive cases etc 
okok i prob will not go to weldon lol imma just be practicing for the rest of the night 
yes no u won t have access to it but i can print for u sorry i disappeared i napped again bc i m that fatigued and sick rn yes no u won t have access to it but i can print for u this message responded to an earlier message wait since u took 1220 last year do uk if the makeup exams are harder than the original ones or anything after i woke up i was that concerned about my symptoms that i got covid tests from front desk and did one my result was negative so i might just have the flu but i have a lot of symptoms for either virus rn but it s really close to the exam and idk if i should get a doctor s note to write a makeup midterm or just power through and write it tmrw morning   and someone told me it s harder on the makeups so idk if that s worth it either 
this was from just yesterday lol login required owl good luck ethan u ve got this how d the exam go shit im acc so sick i forgot the exam ends at 1 pm not 12 pm i didn t even realize until like 10 mins after i sent that text 
btw i did another covid test turned up negative again so i prob have another kind of infection but my sore throat is considerably worse today shit im acc so sick i forgot the exam ends at 1 pm not 12 pm i didn t even realize until like 10 mins after i sent that text this message responded to an earlier message 
wdym 
huh ur phone wasn t on silent 
ethannn 
i am better but not much better so idk about going to friendsgiving tonight cuz i also don t wanna get u all sick 
nooo i don t think it s worth it i m so much less productive bc i m so sick and it s midterms szn i can t do that to u guys 
edited 4 seconds later dude no i m like sick sick that d acc be so irresponsible of me to show up in this condition i can t do that to y all however much fun it d be and however much i d want to come to friendsgivingggg 
nooooo what it s okayyy u guys are all still at ur place right 
omg how late did u guys go until 
damnnn yooo wya 
i m still sick but better 
nono i m part of the momentum team so i was originally gonna be there but i m coughing too much rn and still sick overall 
i was on campus cuz i had class i needed to go to for an inclass assessment then after class i dropped by at the end of the pbsn x wfn career panel today to see how it went and to say hi to everyone and then i was gonna head home to do more work and study by myself but i was feeling a little better so i was debating on doing that around ppl instead but ultimately decided not to as i m still pretty sick and low on energy 
ehhh i just got rice green beans a few pieces of teriyaki pork rib and a bun 
nono i got this food like half an hour ago 
omg no i relate im a bit burnt out rn tho ngl honestly i don t have an exact answer for u i just do what i gotta do some days are easier than others to do that some days it s a lot harder also wya im debating whether or not to work on campus or work at home 
okok wait im acc headed to propel imma go to the washroom and then we can find somewhere else u wanna work at 
lmaooooo im not sure honestly but we can try if u want are u on campus 
ohhh right glgl u ve got this cs kid how was ur exam 
oh shitttt how badly 
im down but im lowkey might not be able to today 
omg wait are u okay u need to see a doctor for a sick note 
okok yeah u need to see an actual doctor for a sick note 
no appointments u have to walk in and wait but they cut off if they hit patient capacity it s a really shitty system i can t just refer u to a specific doctor 
oh shoot sorry i didn t see this like honestly whichever walkin clinic that s open when ur friend is looking to go and has capacity the two that i went to for my doctor s notes this month are wharncliffe walkin clinic and oxford walkin clinic are u still on campus 
wyaaaa 
okkk i m just finishing my lunch that i didn t finish eating i ll come to weldon after 
wdym i found out at 857 pm that u were at weldon or did u mean my food 
oh lmaooooo wait wya in weldon again what floor is weldon maps 
ohhh there okok 
yayyyyyy 
im glad u got to eat hope ur midterm grind went well did u end up acc not sleeping at all 
really wait did u alr do ur midterm how was it 
noooo sleep properly would ve helped w that right it s ok it s overrr 
also are u planning to go out tn 
wait so u ll be back by 12 who are u going out w 
okkk sarah invited me to go out but i m alr out rn so i was thinking of maybe dropping by after but i won t get there until 1145 pm lol which is a bit late so i might not go at all 
lmao probably but i m not gonna drink much until i know what s up w my alcohol allergy cuz at the wfn party i had one full can of twisted tea as uk and just that got me itching later that night which makes sense honestly cuz the other day in dt toronto i was itching like hell but i had a lot more drinks but still just one can triggered that symptom so i m gonna be cautious until ik more 
nono but i acc react physicallymedically to it like i couldn t go into office for a week and i was in torture bc of my allergy reactions that can t happen like look what a week off did to me this past week 
last summer 
internship 
nooo but i still have sruff 
i do acc this year uhhh i acc have a lot of schoolwork 
over reading week 
mrs i m only 19 man no i have not yet but i think i prob will have to write the essay makeup ugh edited 7 seconds later i ll see what i can do tho alsooo are u planning to do hack western i m looking for a team 
hehe yessir if u re down were u thinking of doing it w anyone else already max team size is 4 right 
gotcha who do u think would be good to work w generally 
yeah i ve reached out to her too i think she has a team alr tho 
wdym 
interesting is that the strat cuz i was thinking best ppl for certain areas like 12 designers 23 developers and ppl who have presentation skills are ideal 
yes exactly 
that s why i think we go by domain expertise first wdym 
nooo i ended up not flying out it s this weekend like rn i saw the ig stories it s acc a really big cali hackathon i wish the logistics worked out and i could ve done it ahhh 

i didn t have one i didn t even have a team i just got accepted and i was tryna find other ppl who would be down to fly to sf w me lol did not end up finding enough ppl 
yesss wait do we have to apply as a team not apply as individual hackers then form a team 
yeah so we still technically have time even if we don t officially form by eod let s just brainstorm now who else we want on our team and make sure everyone possible applies by eod 
okok imma do the app now what about xander 
who does hackathons at uwo in general can u just start listing ppl 
kk sounds good 
right the other ppl will have applied too right 
oh really 
how long are they usually live for 
okk what do u think about sherry shu and aaron xie the two of them are planning to do it 
yes bruh she s the one in ur feas group 
bruh smh ok ngl 
rong 
  
ik ppl s last names esp if they re my friends but also generally ok ngl i don t see much of technical skills on aaron s linkedin at least do uk anything about his technicals at all 
sherry said she can ask aaron about us 4 doing it tg but do we want that i ve never seen aaron compete in anything too did he do any previous hackathons 
i agree 
wait what do u think about sherry re hackathons has she done much 
regarding hackathons 
like this interesting what did she win and who was her group 
kk wb annie yu vp education at wfn 
really why also wdym by winning 
cuz ik at hackathons there are a lot of diff awards 
and some ngl i think are way easier than others so i think the credibility differs too like this this message responded to an earlier message okk let s talk tmrw unless i m still up by the time u re free tn 
kk 
ohhh 
i understand but yeah tell me more later kk this message responded to an earlier message 
i ll submit my app rn too wait how are lecia s and jasmine s technicals 
kk about lecia and i kinda get wym with jasmine and what is charles  last name or what does he do if udk his last name 
don t think i ve ever met him but seems like a very dev guy from his linkedin 
but if we go with james then we need one more 
edited 5 seconds later cuz i m assuming sherry aaron are doing it tg and lecia jasmine are too okay that s good i think last one could either be dev or designer but idk if there are any more designers at western lol aside from rachel chen and i idk anyone else 
uxui or product wise 
kk sounds good 
okk lmk when u re done if i m still up we can call 
can we switch to facetime audio i think service on one of our ends is not good i m not on airpods i m legit on speakerphone 
my friend shirley just replied that she s prob not doing hack western cuz she s going on an ivey trip so we can prob count most other hba1s out ngl 
uk it 
literally just got up on stage to receive this 
it s the cursive g wait i m curious do uk cursive 
this message responded to an earlier message 
ohhh yes ic wym yeah i have no idea 
for hack western or what 
just sherry asking if u and i ended up applying 
yes 
yes i have 
it ll help if u wanna get a job at scotia but it might be mostly first years at the comp 
for business kids fs not 100 sure if it s a case comp but pretty sure it is or at least a similar format 
oh wait ptf is same weekend as hack western i don t have as much of a memory about this cuz it went online last year lol so i can t remember what the vibes are for ptf like specifically in terms of whether it s worth for upper years to do it or not 
yes 
oh nvm i don t think it s worth it imma confirm w some other ppl but i don t think it s worth doing for me 
ptf 
i did first round interview hbu 
i m sorry man like acc did u really want cansbridge 
wait how much time did u put into it 
okok that s not bad then right 
oh damnnn ok 2 days that s not just anything then omg yeah i just saw ur missed call wait wdym what happened who s we and what was asked 
w5 startup advisory program what about sap 
okk wb it 
ohhh yeah she did the timing s not the best for this one wait so are we going w lecia jasmine or sherry aaron for hack western the hacker rsvp is individual we don t need to form teams yet but sherry s been following up w me about hack western so i think she s thinking of her aaron me u as a team potentially lmk what u think so i can get back to her 
sounds good to me should we still try to get other ppl on our notion 
wait can u update on the notion doc like who u reached out to i just did too if there s no one left to reach out to then we re good to go w lecia jasmine i just wanna make sure we ve covered all our bases 
yes yes no rush i will be irl w sherry in like 2 hours tho if she brings it up 
wdym 
okok i was gonna say i will tell her that u and i are likely going w another team but still keep it as idk like if there s no one else on the doc left to ask then we re going w lecia jasmine fs lecia jasmine are still without a full team right 
okk i will tell sherry idk then until u ve had a chance to confirm w lecia
